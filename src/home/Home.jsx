      If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
      When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next
      logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random
      Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose
      the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button.
      Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear. While it may not
      be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random
      paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this
      generator are listed in the following paragraphs. Creative Writing
      Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
      their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
      idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
      forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
      writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a
      short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
      paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
      have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
      matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
      use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. If you're
